Revision history for Perl extension WWW::Amazon::Wishlist.

0.6   Fri Dec 07 11:55:43 2001
        - added some fixes from Rhet Turnball for not getting pages
          properly and adding some items twice. Yay Open Source!

        - also added 'amazonwish' a script to go and grab your 
          wishlist for you and spew out the total.
