WWW::Amazon::Wishlist - grab all the details from your Amazon wishlist

-----------------------------------
INSTALL
-----------------------------------


the usual ...

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

Remember peeps, It's bad to do 'make test' as root. In fact, try to do as 
little as possible as root. Only do the 'make install' as root. Root is bad. 
Root is scary. Tree pretty. Beer Foamy. Fire bad.

You have been warned.

It also installs a utility called amazonwish which will grab your amazon wishlist for you and total it up.

SYNOPSIS
-----------------------------------


  use WWW::Amazon::Wishlist qw(get_list);
  
  my @wishlist;
  
  @wishlist = get_list ($my_amazon_com_id);      # gets it from amazon.com
  @wishlist = get_list ($my_amazon_com_id,  0);  # same, explicitly
  @wishlist = get_list ($my_amazon_couk_id, 1);  # gets it from amazon.co.uk
  
  # the elements of @wishlist are hashrefs that contain ...
  foreach my $book (@wishlist)
  {
  	print $book->{title},   # the, err, title
	      $book->{author},  # and the author(s) 
	      $book->{asin},    # the asin number, its unique id on Amazon
	      $book->{price},	# how much it will set you back
	      $book->{type};    # Hardcover/Paperback/CD/DVD etc
  
  }

DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------


Goes to Amazon.(com|co.uk) and scrapes away your wishlist and returns it in a array of hashrefs so that you can fiddle with it until your hearts content.


-----------------------------------
GETTING YOUR AMAZON ID
-----------------------------------


The best way to do this is to search for your own wishlist in the search tools.

Searching for mine (simon@twoshortplanks.com) on amazon.com takes me to the URL

   http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/2EAJG83WS7YZM/ 
 
there's some more cruft after that last string of numbers and letters but it's the

   2EAJG83WS7YZM
   
bit that's important.

Doing the same for amazon.co.uk is just as easy.

SHOWING YOUR APPRECIATION
-----------------------------------

There was a thread on london.pm mailing list about working in a vacumn - that it was a bit depressing to keep writing
modules but never get any feedback. So, if you use and like this module then please send me an email and make my day. 

All it takes is a few little bytes.

Either that or you have the adress of my Amazon Wishlist, it's huge, buy something for me off it :)
