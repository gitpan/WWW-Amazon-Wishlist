IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT INTERIM RELEASE 1.501
------------------------------------------

Release of distribution version 1.501 was made by Martin Thurn, with Simon's permission of course.
However, at the moment, the UK parse code is not working.
Also, at the moment, it is not able to look beyond the first page of your wishlist.
We apologize for these shortcomings, and we will work on them "real soon now".  
We also apologize that this release was not in time to help you get ready for Christmas.

-----------------------------------
INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------

The usual ...

% perl Makefile.PL
% make test
% make install

Remember peeps, It's bad to do 'make test' as root.  In fact, try to do as 
little as possible as root.  Only do the 'make install' as root.  Root is bad. 
Root is scary.  Tree pretty.  Beer Foamy.  Fire bad.

You have been warned.

It also installs a utility called amazonwish, which will grab your amazon wishlist for you and total it up.

-----------------------------------
DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------

Goes to Amazon.(com|co.uk) and scrapes away your wishlist and returns it in a array of hashrefs so that you can fiddle with it until your hearts content.

SHOWING YOUR APPRECIATION
-----------------------------------

There was a thread on london.pm mailing list about working in a vacuum
- that it was a bit depressing to keep writing modules but never get
any feedback. So, if you use and like this module then please send me
an email and make my day.

All it takes is a few little bytes.

Either that or you have the adress of my Amazon Wishlist, it's huge, buy something for me off it :)
