WWW::Amazon::Wishlist - grab details from an Amazon wishlist

-----------------------------------
INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------

The usual ...

% perl Makefile.PL
% make test
% make install

Remember peeps, It's bad to do 'make test' as root.  In fact, try to do as 
little as possible as root.  Only do the 'make install' as root.  Root is bad. 
Root is scary.  Tree pretty.  Beer Foamy.  Fire bad.

You have been warned.

It also installs a utility called amazonwish, which will grab your amazon wishlist for you and total it up.

-----------------------------------
DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------

Goes to Amazon.(com|co.uk) and scrapes away your wishlist and returns it in a array of hashrefs so that you can fiddle with it until your hearts content.

Note: Items marked as "currently unavailable" are not returned.  (This may be considered a bug...)

-----------------------------------
SHOWING YOUR APPRECIATION
-----------------------------------

There was a thread on london.pm mailing list about working in a vacuum
- that it was a bit depressing to keep writing modules but never get
any feedback. So, if you use and like this module then please send me
an email and make my day.

All it takes is a few little bytes.

Either that or you have the adress of my Amazon Wishlist, it's huge, buy something for me off it :)
